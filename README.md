How to use:
Open the command prompt at where the mcb.bat is present and enter these in the prompt to use: <br />
    mcb save <keyword>  -saves clipboard to keyword <br />
    mcb <keyword>       -loads the keyword content <br />
    mcb list            -lists all the keywords <br />
    mcb del <keyword>   -deletes that particular keyword <br />
    mcb del             -deletes all the keywords <br />
